# Markdummy

Kick-ass markdown file viewer and editor. Attention: save in download folder will not work.

You can get a signed APK (4.1+) from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/Markdummy/master/app/release/de.digisocken.markdummy.apk)

It is just an blueprint improvement... viewing files is the prio.
